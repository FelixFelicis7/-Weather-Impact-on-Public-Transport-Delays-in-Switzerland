# Weather Impact on Public Transport Delays in Switzerland



This project investigates how weather conditions influenced public transportation delays in Switzerland during 2024. 
Using daily weather data (from january/april/july/november) from NBCN stations and traffic data from national and regional train and bus operators, 
we aim to analyze regional and seasonal patterns of delays. This project focuses on two key analysis goals:

Understanding the **regional sensitivity** to weather by comparing delays across cantons under different weather conditions, such as snow or rain.
Examining **seasonal and extreme weather impacts**, identifying trends like increased delays in winter or during heavy rain.
